Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
// Cafe overloaded methods
I chose to overload the constuctor by making one with only one parameter which is name, and onether one with both name and the address. I chose those two because to me they can define cafe.
//House overloded methods
I have overloaded the constructor and GoToFloor(). For the constructor it was the same intuition as the one for cafe but for the GoToFloor() I wanted to check if it if i am using the constuctor that did not defined that it has constructor but define it in the the call of GoToFloor() the both worked which was my test.

I have decided to overload the "constructor" so that some buildings will be checked for the elevator access.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
